                Main article: List of Jujutsu Kaisen characters<br>
                Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instils two powerful messages <br>
                within Itadori: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Itadori's friends at the Occult Club attracted Curses to their school<br>
                 when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Itadori swallowed to protect Megumi Fushiguro and his friends, becoming host to a powerful<br>
                  Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Itadori) immediately.<br>
                   But upon seeing Itadori retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School<br>
                    with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Itadori's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers so the <br>
                    Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including<br>
                     the Cursed spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior. The Kyoto school's principal <br>
                     wants Itadori dead immediately at the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools. In contrast, others, including fellow <br>
                     student Nobara Kugisaki, side with Gojo to keep Itadori alive.<br>

                                           I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                            Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                            I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                            I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                            Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                            Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                            Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
