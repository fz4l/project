            <p> Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga <br>
                series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-in<br>
                spired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a <br>
                lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band <br>
                of the Hawk". Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began<br>
                 the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal <br>
                 House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, <br>
                 where Berserk has continued its publication. Following Miura's death in May <br>
                 2021, the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was published posthumo<br>
                 usly in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under su<br>
                 pervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori [ja] <br>
                 and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.<br>

        <ul class="py4">
           <p> Guts is a lone warrior who was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by his abusive adoptive father Gambino.<br>
             It came to a head when Guts was forced to kill a drunk Gambino in self-defense, fleeing his mercenary group and becoming a <br>
             wandering sellsword. His fearsome reputation catches the attention of Griffith, the charismatic leader of a mercenary group <br>
             known as the Band of the Hawk. Griffith forces Guts to join the group after defeating him in battle, with Guts becoming his <br>
             best fighter and main confidante. The Band is hired by the kingdom of Midland to help in its century-long war against the Chuder<br>
              Empire. Guts learns of Griffith's desire to rule a kingdom of his own and his mysterious pendant known as a Behelit. The Behelit<br>
               is instrumental when they are spared by Nosferatu Zodd, a monstrous immortal who leaves Guts with a cryptic warning of a painful<br>
                demise for being Griffith's friend.<br>

       <p> Berserk is regarded as one of the most influential dark fantasy works.[235][236][237][238] Peter Fobian, in an essay of the<br>
         legacy and impact of Berserk, called it a "monolith not only for anime and manga, but also fantasy literature, video games, you<br>
          name it," comparing its level of influence to Blade Runner, further adding: "it's difficult to imagine what the world might look <br>
          like without it, and the generations of creators the series inspired."[224]<br>

        According to writer and editor Kazushi Shimada, series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba or <br>
        Jujutsu Kaisen would not have existed if not for Berserk.[239] Some dark fantasy manga authors who have declared influence from Berserk<br>
         include Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan),[240] Kazue Kato (Blue Exorcist)[241] and Yana Toboso (Black Butler).[242] Other authors <br>
         influenced by Berserk include Makoto Yukimura (Vinland Saga),[243] Yūki Tabata (Black Clover)[244] and Ryōgo Narita (Baccano! and <br>
         Durarara!!).[245] Adi Shankar, showrunner of the Castlevania animated series, said in an interview that he would like to adapt Berserk,<br>
          calling the "hyper-detailed beauty" of Miura's artwork a "true masterpiece",[246] while Adam Deats, Castlevania assistant director, <br>
          stated that the show was inspired by Berserk.<br>

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
