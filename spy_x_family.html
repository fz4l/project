        <ul class="py4">
           <p> In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of Westalis and Ostania,[a] a Westalian agent code-named "Twilight" <br>
            is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously <br>
            reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow<br>
             parent.
                    To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named <br>
                    Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and Yor is in fact a professional assassin.<br>
                     Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true identities, or that Anya knows their true professions. The family later takes in a<br>
                      dog with precognitive abilities whom they name Bond. Despite these unknown factors and Twilight's occasional lapses of common sense due<br>
                       to years of being a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission.</p>

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">I think manga is better maybe it's black and white but if you let your mind think put some color in your imagination it will look really awesome also manga is more detailed in fights than manhwa also author and artists of manga not usually use digital they more on using inks also they make story that have a good plot twist because shonen jump or shueisha will stop or cut their story if it's not catchy or if it is not different in others also they are strict in their manga artist if they send a schedule to them they need to finish it before the publishing day also mangaka or manga artist have a different art you may see it in many manga not all character have the same look also the panel is detailed also it's awesome because they use right to left reading in manga if some say manhwa is better because it's colored just wait for manga artist or fan and individuals make digitally colored manga and sometimes mangaka release a full colored manga if they have extra time in their schedule

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">Comics serve their purpose best than any other invention. A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">Pros: From a reader’s perspective, one of the best quality of Line WEBTOON is that the comics that you can read are free (unless you want to purchase FastPass to read ahead). Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
