            <p> DC Rebirth is a 2016 relaunch by the American comic book<br>
                publisher DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly <br>
                superhero comic book titles. Using the end of The New 52 <br>
                initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, DC Rebirth<br>
                restored the DC Universe to a form much like that prior <br>
                to the 2011 "Flashpoint" storyline while still incorporating<br>
                numerous elements of The New 52, including its continuity.<br>
                It also saw many of its titles move to a twice-monthly<br>
                release schedule, along with being released at US$2.99.<br>
                DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017,<br> 
                opting to include everything under a larger "DC Universe" <br>
                banner and naming. The continuity and repercussions <br>
                established by Rebirth continues into the New Justice <br>
                (2018–2021), Infinite Frontier (2021–2023), <br> Dawn of DC relaunch.

   <section id="Quick Summary">
    <div class="you1" style="background-color:rgb(35, 33, 33) ;">
        <h2 class="heading" style="color: white;">Quick Summary</h2>
        <ul class="py4" style="color: white;">
           <p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 250px;"> Pros: The story present throughout this issue is personal and touching in a way that few comic book stories are.<br>
             In addition, the theme of this work is perfect and matches the current state of comics very well. Plus, this issue<br>
              has tons of small details in it to get readers excited for future comic series.<br>
            Cons: Readers looking for this book to majorly alter the DC universe as a whole will be underwhelmed.<br>
            Overall: This is a comic book that changes the DC universe in ways that transcend the physical aspects of the story. <br>
            Though the return of one legacy character is moving and wonderful, it isn’t even the best part of the book. The best <br>
            part of this book is the metaphorical change in tone that it promises. Bringing legacy and love back to comic books<br>
             is a worthwhile goal and is something to look forward to from DC.

<div class="you1">
    <h2 class="heading">Art</h2>
    <ul class="py4">
        
       <p style="margin-left: 500px;">The combined team of Gary Frank, Ethan Van Sciver, Ivan Reis, and Phil Jimenez team up in order to present the art for<br>
         this issue. The outcome of this is fantastic. These are some of the better artists, in terms of consistent quality, working<br>
          for DC Comics today, so the work is guaranteed to look great. Characters and locations are realistic looking and gorgeously<br>
           detailed in a way that makes them look as if they could jump off the page in certain places. Overall this is one good looking<br>
            comic book.
        
        The art doesn’t just look great though, it also helps make the book better by enhancing the themes present in the book as well.<br>
         For example, on pages with Watchmen references, the comic turns into a nine panel grid. Then, on pages where the past is shown,<br>
          the art style changes to accommodate the art style of the time. These things are just subtle details which, when viewed together,<br>
           help make this a better comic book.
        </p>

<!-------- Continuity------------>

<section id=" Continuity" style="background-color: rgb(35, 33, 33);">
<div class="you1"><div class="dcr1"><img src="img/dc rebirth/dc_rebirth_1.jpg"></div>
    <h2 class="heading" style="color: white;"> Continuity</h2>
    <ul class="py4" style="color:white">
    <p style="margin-left: 150px;">  DC Universe: Rebirth stands on its own without being directly related to any other work. It officially marks the end of the New 52 <br>
        era of DC Comics and begins the Rebirth era. Because of this, the optimal location for this issue in the universal reading order would <br>
        be directly after every New 52 comic and directly before every Rebirth comic. Obviously it does not reference every comic so a list of<br>
         comics it does reference is detailed below.
        
        The story in this comic is directly continued in “The Button” event. Reviews of this event can be found here: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, <br>
        Part 4.
        
        In addition, please note that although this comic marks the separation between two separate eras, it does not mark a significant change <br>
        in continuity. The Rebirth universe is still the same universe as the New 52 universe. The only difference between the two is that a few<br>
         elements of the pre-Flashpoint universe have made their way into this universe. The extent to which pre and post-Flashpoint universes have<br>
          blended is currently unknown but appears to still be extremely limited.

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
