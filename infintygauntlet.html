            <p style="background-color:rgb(35, 33, 33); color: white; padding: 100px;"> The Infinity Gauntlet is an American comic book storyline published by Marvel Comics. In addition to an eponymous, six-issue limited<br>
                 series written by Jim Starlin and pencilled by George Pérez and Ron Lim, crossover chapters appeared in related comic books. Since its<br>
                  initial serialization from July to December 1991, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions.<br>
                The series' events are driven by Thanos, a nihilist character created for Marvel by Starlin in 1973. When Starlin began writing Silver<br> 
                 Surfer in 1990, he and Lim began a new plot with Thanos that developed over sixteen monthly issues and a spin-off limited series before<br> 
                  concluding in The Infinity Gauntlet. Pérez was brought in to draw The Infinity Gauntlet because he had more name recognition among fans<br> 
                   and because Lim already had a full schedule. However, after completing three issues and part of the fourth, his own busy schedule and<br> 
                    dissatisfaction with the story led to him being replaced by Lim.<br> 
            
                At the start of The Infinity Gauntlet, the character Thanos has collected all six Infinity Gems and attached them to his gauntlet. With<br> 
                 their combined power, he becomes "like a god" and sets out to win the affection of Mistress Death, the living embodiment of death in <br> 
                 the Marvel Universe. When Thanos uses his powers to instantly erase half of the life in the universe from existence, Adam Warlock leads <br> 
                 Earth's remaining heroes against him. After the Infinity Gauntlet is stolen by Thanos' villainous granddaughter Nebula, Thanos aids the <br> 
                 remaining heroes in defeating her. Warlock ultimately obtains the Infinity Gauntlet and uses its power to undo all it had wrought.<br> 
                The series was a top seller for Marvel during publication and was followed by two immediate sequels, The Infinity War (1992) and The<br> 
                 Infinity Crusade (1993). The story's events continued to be referenced in other Marvel comics for decades. The Infinity Gauntlet <br> 
                 remained popular among fans, warranting multiple reprint editions and merchandise, with its themes and plot elements adapted into <br> 
                 video games and animated cartoons. Most notable among later adaptions was the "Infinity Saga" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which<br> 
                  incorporated elements of the original comic story into a saga that spanned across almost two dozen connected films.<br>

            <p>Plot
                Resurrected by Mistress Death to correct a perceived imbalance between life and death, the Titan Thanos first encounters the Silver <br> 
                Surfer, and subsequently fakes his own death to proceed without interference.[43] Thanos decides to reacquire the six Infinity Gems <br> 
                that he had previously used as a simple weapon. After defeating several of the Elders of the Universe and the In-Betweener, Thanos<br> 
                 regains the gems and now has control over the six aspects of existence: Time, Space, Mind, Soul, Reality and Power. Ironically,<br> 
                  now that Thanos is in possession of his "Infinity Gauntlet", Death advises him via an intermediary she cannot speak directly to <br> 
                  him as he is now her superior.[44]<br> 
                
                When the Silver Surfer learns that Thanos is still alive and confronts him, Thanos traps the Silver Surfer's soul inside the Soul Gem.<br> 
                [45] On "Soul World", the Silver Surfer encounters former enemy of Thanos, Adam Warlock. Warlock returns the Surfer to his body and<br> 
                 promises to help defeat Thanos.[46] The Surfer races to Earth to warn super-team the Avengers about the coming threat.[47] Demonic <br> 
                 entity Mephisto senses the power in the Infinity Gauntlet and offers to instruct Thanos in its use, while secretly waiting for an <br> 
                 opportunity to steal it for himself.[48]<br> 
                
                Angry at Mistress Death's rejection, Thanos creates a shrine in her image, and then traps and burns Nebula – who pretended to be his <br> 
                "grand-daughter" – as an offering. When still rejected, Thanos in a fit of rage destroys several stars and then eliminates half of all<br> 
                 living beings in the universe. The Surfer warns Doctor Strange about Thanos and encourages him to summon Earth's heroes.[49] Cosmic<br> 
                  entities Galactus and Epoch seek the source of the sudden imbalance, while Warlock and companions Gamora and Pip the Troll leave Soul<br> 
                   World and occupy recently dead humans on Earth, reviving and altering the bodies to match their former appearance. Warlock appears<br> 
                    before Doctor Strange and claims Thanos can only be defeated if Earth's remaining heroes unite under his command.[50]<br>

            <p>Avengers Infinity War is the direct adaptation of Infinity Gauntlet and Thanos Quest where Thanos has to find all<br>
                 infinity stones and impress death who gave her life, without thinking a single second, Thanos kills crores of <br>
                 people by a just small work, this arises as the concepts of this comics, I loved this comic, and this is the <br>
                 oldest Marvel comic among that comics I read till today. Hence also after 3 years of movie and nearly 30 years<br>
                  of comic, People loved to read this comic, Hence Now The MCU current Loki episode 2 was just a twist to show, <br>
                  and lastly I want to conclude that Marvel is very ossum and DC ais also a universe of stories<br>

                                           I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                            Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                            I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                            I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                            Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                            Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                            Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
