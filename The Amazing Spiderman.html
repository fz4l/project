            <p> The Amazing Spider-Man is an ongoing American superhero comic book series featuring<br> 
                the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man as its title character and main protagonist. <br>
                Being in the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it was the character's first title<br>
                , launching seven months after his introduction in the final issue of Amazing Fantasy.<br>
                 The series began publication with a March 1963 cover date and has been published <br>nearly
                 continuously to date over six volumes with only one significant interruption.<br> Issues of
                  the title currently feature an issue number within its 6th volume, as well<br> as a "legacy" 
                  number reflecting the issue's overall number across all Amazing <br>Spider-Man volumes. The 
                  title reached 900 issues in 2022.<br>

        <ul class="py4">
           <p> Writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Steve Ditko created the character of Spider-Man,[2] and the pair<br>
             produced 38 issues from March 1963 to July 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until <br>
             issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the <br>
             <br>adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero.<br>



            The Amazing Spider-Man has been the character's flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, <br>
            and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, in 1976, although<br>
             1972 saw the debut of Marvel Team-Up, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating<br>
              cast of other Marvel characters. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been <br>
              introduced in Amazing, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character's history have<br>
               occurred. The title was published continuously until No. 441 (Nov. 1998)[3] when Marvel Comics relaunched it <br>
               as vol. 2 No. 1 (Jan. 1999),[4] but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the n<br>
               umbering of the original series, beginning again with issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final <br>
               issue, No. 700 (Feb. 2013).<br>

       <p> The series began as a bimonthly periodical before being increased to monthly after four issues. It was the character's <br>
        sole monthly headlining title until Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man launched in 1976. After 441 issues, Amazing<br>
         Spider-Man was restarted in 1999 as issue No. 1 of Volume 2. It ran for 58 issues before reverting to the title's overall <br>
         issue number with #500 in 2003. The series ran essentially continuously over the first two volumes from 1963 until its<br>
          landmark 700th issue at the end of 2012 when it was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man as part of the Marvel NOW! <br>
          relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.[1] The title was occasionally published biweekly during the first two volumes, and <br>
          was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. After the relaunch of Action Comics and Detective Comics in 2011, <br>
          Amazing Spider-Man briefly became the highest-numbered active American comic book.<br>

    <p style="margin-left: 750px; margin-top: -400px;"> The Amazing Spider-Man returned with volume 3 in April 2014 following the conclusion of The Superior Spider-Man story arc for 18 issues. In late 2015, the series was relaunched with a 4th volume following the 2015 Secret Wars event. After 32 issues, the volume was one again relaunched as part of Marvel Legacy, returning to the overall "legacy" numbering with issue No. 789 in late 2017. Less than a year later, the series was relaunched again with a 5th volume as part of Marvel's Fresh Start. For the first time, although the issue numbers were again restarted from #1, the issues also bore the overall "legacy" issue number. A 6th volume commenced in April 2022 to celebrate Spider-Man's 60th anniversary. Since the third volume, the title has had various release schedules including monthly and bi-weekly, among others.

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">Pros: From a reader’s perspective, one of the best quality of Line WEBTOON is that the comics that you can read are free (unless you want to purchase FastPass to read ahead). Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
