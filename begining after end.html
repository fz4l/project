            <p> Arthur Leywin is the main protagonist of The Beginning After The End. <br>
                In his previous life, he was a king named Grey before he was reincarnat<br>
                ed into a new world, on the continent of Dicathen.<br>

                In his former world, he lived as a king who stood on the top of his cou<br>
                ntry in terms of combat, until he was presumably assassinated through <br>
                poison one day. However, after living four years as Arthur Leywin, he <br>
                reawoke as King Grey, as if he wasn't poisoned.<br>
                
                After being reincarnated into the Leywin Family, Grey decided that, <br>
                unlike his previous life, he would live his life to the fullest. To be <br>
                loved, and surrounded by the friends and family he was void of in his <br>
                past life.<br>

            As King Grey, Arthur had pale, short blonde hair. He had a large build from extensive training and was seen wearing a pale, yellow robe or<br>
             tunic with long white pants that end just before his calves paired with brown sandals. During times of war, Grey is seen in a full-body <br>
             armor suit.
            
            Born as Arthur Leywin, Arthur had short auburn brown hair and large bright azure eyes. He had a small round face and was generally dressed <br>
            in solid-colored fabrics by his mother.[10] As he grew older, Arthur's hair started to grow longer, with short bangs sweeping across his <br>
            forehead. At the age of eight, Arthur had grown taller and his hair had grown significantly, extending just past his ears, above his neck.<br>
            Once he had returned from Elenoir to Xyrus City in Sapin, Arthur had a hair cut which left him having short hair with long bangs that sweep <br>
            across his forehead. He often wore solid-colored shorts matched with a button-up shirt. His shoes were typically brown and he opted to wear<br>
             long socks although this is only on the cover of the Tapas and kakaopage comics. In the comics themselves, he would often wear a white <br>
             button-up shirt with a string necktie and grey shorts with brown suspenders. As for footwear, he would wear black dress shoes likely w<br>
             ithout socks.[12]
            
            As an adventurer, Arthur wears a black turtleneck long sleeve paired with black pants and boots. He wears a loose, pale, argyle shirt <br>
            beneath a hooded, navy blue jacket with grey markings across the sleeves. His face is covered with a white, full-face mask with a blue ha<br>
            lf note printed alongside his left eye hole. Arthur wears black, spiked aurochs skinned, fingerless gloves with three green, single-use h<br>
            ealing spell gems embedded on the knuckles. Along with his gloves, he also wears a silver ring on his ring finger, a matching pair with<br>
             his mother's red jeweled ring. He also carries a dark olive hiker's backpack with a green sleeping bag rolled up beneath it and his two <br>
             swords strapped on both sides of his waist.[13]
            
            Arthur Leywin, as a teenager, was of above-average height, taller than<br> many of the adults around him, with auburn hair and azure eyes.

       <p style="margin-left: 500px;">The Beginning and the End (Arabic: بداية ونهاية) is a novel by Egyptian writer<br>
         Naguib Mahfouz, first published in 1949. The novel is set in the suburbs of Cairo in the late 1930s and deals<br>
          with the trials and tribulations of a middle-class family who are struggling to keep out of poverty <br>
          after the death of the father, the sole breadwinner. The novel is marked by very bold <br>
          characterization for the time period and setting, and the story moves at a prolific pace as it tries to <br>
          look at the world from each character's viewpoint.<br>

        Personality<br>
        King Grey's reincarnation into the new world as Arthur allowed his personality and memories to be carried over, <br>
        influencing how his new personality developed. This led to him having an astoundingly mature personality all <br>
        throughout his early life and adolescence, often thinking of the big picture and accurately understanding the events<br>
         and the impact of such events that are occurring around him. Although his logical maturity was very high due to him<br>
          having lived more than 35 years already, because of how he lived his previous life with an emotional "shell" around<br>
           his mind preventing him from connecting to anyone closely, his emotional maturity does leave a lot to be desired as <br>
           he is seen to struggle constanly when dealing with the emotions his newfound loved ones give him. This can lead to <br>
           him sometimes reacting excessively and explosively when they are threatened or at risk. After the war is lost and<br>
            Sylvie sacficed her physical body to save him from his over usage of realmheart he became cold and detached like <br>
            his past life almost losing his sanity and empathy also his hatred for the alacryans increased tremendsoly. if it<br>
             was not for Regis who prevents him from falling to despair and insanity. Another reason that he retained his empathy<br>
              when he meet Caera an alacryan noble who took pity on him also later befriended him which lead to letting go of <br>
              his hatred toward the alacryans and pins the blame for everything that happened on Agrona vritra and Kezess indrath<br>
              After returning to Dicthaen he returns to his normal self also stopped being cold and detached like in his <br>
              Grey persona.
        
        
        Background<br>
        In his previous life, Arthur lived by the name Grey. He lived on a dystopian, futuristic Earth, as an orphan in an<br>
         orphanage alongside his childhood friends Nico Sever and Cecilia. Due to the somewhat impoverished nature of the<br>
          orphanage he lived in, Grey and Nico resorted to criminal activities (predominantly burglary of the rich) to assist<br>
           their home's situation. Following the death of his motherly figure, who was the Headmaster of the orphanage, Grey's <br>
           mind was consumed by revenge and in a bid to gain more power enrolled in cadet school, despite its risks, to become <br>
           king.[14] Throughout his later life as King Grey, he eschewed any and all long-term attachments; seeing them as <br>
           weaknesses that others could exploit and in doing so hardened his heart and closed off his emotions. Soon after the<br>
            wars were replaced by Paragon Duels, Grey retired from being the king.<br>

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.                        
                                        “Comics are words and pictures. You can do anything with words and pictures.”

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">Pros: From a reader’s perspective, one of the best quality of Line WEBTOON is that the comics that you can read are free (unless you want to purchase FastPass to read ahead). Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
