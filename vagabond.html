        <ul class="py4">
            <p>The story starts in 1600, in the aftermath of the decisive Battle of Sekigahara. Two 17-year-old teenagers who joined the losing side, <br>
                Takezō Shinmen and Matahachi Hon'iden, lie wounded in the battlefield and pursued by survivor hunters. They manage to escape and swear <br>
                to become Invincible Under The Heavens (天下無双, Tenka Musō). They find housing with two women, but are soon attacked by the Tsujikaze<br>
                 gang, and in the confusion of the fight their paths separate: Takezō decides to become a vagabond and wander the world challenging strong <br>
                 opponents, and Matahachi chooses to stay with the women. Takezō returns to his hometown, the Miyamoto village, to tell Matahachi's mother, <br>
                 Osugi Hon'iden, that her son is alive. However, Osugi reacts hostile because the village detests Takezō for his extremely violent and antis<br>
                 ocial tendencies, and because the future of the Hon'iden gentry family is compromised now that their heir Matahachi is missing. Osugi pulls <br>
                 strings to accuse Takezō of being a criminal. Takezō fights his pursuers but is eventually caught by the monk Takuan Sōhō, who makes him <br>
                 reconsider his purpose in life. Takuan frees him and, to make him start his life anew, renames him Musashi Miyamoto. Thus begins a story <br>
                 that will show how the legend of the acclaimed sword master Musashi Miyamoto was forged.<br>

                Takehiko Inoue started Vagabond having wondered what the character was like when he read Musashi. Having come off <br>
                of drawing a sports manga, he wanted to create a series about more basic concepts, such as "life and death, the human<br>
                 condition, etc.". Rather than portray Musashi's later life in his "enlightened state", which has been written about <br>
                 often, the author chose to depict the lesser known "young man reaching that point of enlightenment when he comes from<br>
                  a place of being so like an animal". In 2009, he stated that he made his weekly deadline thanks to only having to<br>
                   draw the people, with his five assistants drawing the backgrounds.<br>

                                           I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                            Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                            I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                            I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.

                                          <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">I think manga is better maybe it's black and white but if you let your mind think put some color in your imagination it will look really awesome also manga is more detailed in fights than manhwa also author and artists of manga not usually use digital they more on using inks also they make story that have a good plot twist because shonen jump or shueisha will stop or cut their story if it's not catchy or if it is not different in others also they are strict in their manga artist if they send a schedule to them they need to finish it before the publishing day also mangaka or manga artist have a different art you may see it in many manga not all character have the same look also the panel is detailed also it's awesome because they use right to left reading in manga if some say manhwa is better because it's colored just wait for manga artist or fan and individuals make digitally colored manga and sometimes mangaka release a full colored manga if they have extra time in their schedule

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                            Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                            Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                            Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
