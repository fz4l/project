       <p> 
        As the world was plunged into darkness due to the Silent Night, martial arts masters gathered to form the “Northern<br> 
        Heavenly Sect”. Thanks to it, people found peace and tranquility again. Over time, however, martial arts masters began<br>
         plotting against the Northern Heavenly Sect seeing the sect as a threat due to its immense power. Eventually, this <br>
         leads to the death of the sect leader, Jin Kwan-Ho, and the destruction of the sect with him.<br>

        
        After everyone leaves the sect, only Jin Kwan-Ho’s son, Jin Mu-Won, stays with the sect. Mu-Won never studied <br>
        martial arts, but he knows about the secret Martial Arts left to him by his father and known only to him. He starts <br>
        studying the martial arts of the Northern Heavenly Sect.<br>

                                       I love when it is studied and discussed as critically and intelligently as film and graphics arts like painting.                                           
                                        Everyone should read Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics to see what’s at work in the background when a successful comic is put together.                                          
                                        I enjoy reading about the the history of the industry – the creators involved, the publishing machinations and market forces that helped shape the modern comics business.                                          
                                        I like that it can be slickly produced high art or can be a low-fi garage punk experiment and have both be highly enjoyable and important.                        
                                        “Comics are words and pictures. You can do anything with words and pictures.”

A quick Google search reveals that comics were invented to fight depression and trauma in real world during WWII. Be it be the stalwarts like Marvel and DC or any other comic house still help children and adults fight trauma in life and provide an escape route from reality for a while.
                                        Comics not only taught us not only that monsters exist but they can be slated. Comics often provided me with a get away from real time issues to refresh myself and provided me with new hope and new perspectives in life. Rich back story backed by real production values have always driven comics away from reality providing the wonderland to children who were traumatised and bogged down by real life’s cruelty.

                                      <p class="m-b-5 m-t-10">Pros: From a reader’s perspective, one of the best quality of Line WEBTOON is that the comics that you can read are free (unless you want to purchase FastPass to read ahead). Updates for most are weekly, but since there’s a whole bunch you can subscribe to, you probably won’t go a day without one of your comics updating! They offer a lot of genres with an entire spectrum of art styles so you’re bound to find something you like.
                                        Cons: This is more personal dislikes, but since the majority of the audience are teens, the comment section is usually littered with immaturity. I usually like to read through the comments to see other people’s thoughts/reactions/theories… but yea— sometimes it’s better not to. The top comments especially make me wonder how they even got so many upvotes.                                           
                                        Also, since the platform is catered towards a younger audience, I find it hard to find stories with more depth and mature themes. But that’s just another personal preference
